Because the Indiana limestone-clad facade building was designed by famed architect Robert A.M. Stern, the former Dean of Architecture at Yale? Its position directly on Central Park West and the famed Central Park itself? Its 14,000sf fitness center and 75 foot-long swimming pool with daylight overhead? Its private in-house restaurant with butler service? The 20-seat screening room? Conference facilities for private meetings or on-site parking? Perhaps the white-glove service from an experienced staff? The answer: all of the above. When these features are added to its superb construction, they have rendered the highest condominium resale in all of New York at $88 million or $13,354 per square foot.THE RENTAL APARTMENTPositioned near the top of the Tower, this exquisite three bedroom, three and a half bath apartment is the highest available rental on the market in this prime building. Three of the major rooms span 40 feet of Central Park views from which to observe the changing seasons, the sun, and the clouds.

A Sustainable Community: There is a plethora of eco-friendly hardware in the building. The green roof features a 40-panel, 14.4 kW solar canopy (one of only a few in Manhattan). Motion sensor lights have been installed strategically throughout the building, mirror arrays redirect sunlight to the lower floors, and low-flow showerheads and toilets are in every bathroom.

Furthermore, we regularly host community events where you can meet other members throughout the building so you can build relationships that last beyond your stay with us.
